hi Youâ€™ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format:

`YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP`

Where `YEAR` is a four-digit number, `MONTH` and `DAY` are both two-digit numbers, and `MARKUP` is the file extension representing the format used in the file. After that, include the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets.

This is SQL

{% highlight sql %}
CREATE TABLE employees (
    emp_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    fname VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    lname VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    dept VARCHAR(50),
    salary DECIMAL(10,2) DEFAULT 30000.00,
    hire_date DATE NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_DATE
);
{% endhighlight %}

This is python code:

{% highlight python %}
import os
a = "HI, I am "
b = 21
print (a+b)

{% endhighlight %}
